## Introduction
In this module, we explore **HTML5**, the latest version of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML5 introduces new features that enhance web development, including new elements, attributes, and behaviors. These assignments are designed to help students understand these features and implement them in web development projects.

## Assignments

In this assignment, I created a simple online **Resume** using HTML5. The focus was on structuring a webpage with different sections like personal details, education, and work experience.
